The ordering of damage states _SHALL_ be from left (normal state) to right (destroyed state). All intermediate states must represent increasingly damaged states from a slightly damaged state to an almost destroyed state. The number of states is left to the discretion of the modeler.{set:cellbgcolor:#FFFFFF}
