== CDB OpenFlight Models

This volume of the CDB standard defines a set of conventions for representing 2D and 3D models based on version 16.0 of the OpenFlight Scene Description Database Specification as annotated in Appendix C of this document.
The conventions presented here address the needs of several types of simulation clients including OTW, FLIR, NVG, CGF, radar, and laser, acoustic, magnetic, visual and thermal sensors.

=== OpenFlight File Header

The OpenFlight Header Record contains descriptive coordinate reference system (CRS) metadata about the manner vertices are encoded, and how these vertices are applied to an earth model and a projection type. On the other hand, the CDB standard itself mandates a prescribed set of conventions in this regard.
