|*Dependency* 2+|Openflight Specification
|*Test 7* 2+|/conf/model-conventions/crs-models
| |*Requirement* |/req/openflight/crs-models
| |*Test purpose* |Verifythat CDB Models use the same coordinate system convention as OpenFlight
| |*Test method* |Visual. Pass if the CRS definitions are the same.
| |*Test type* |Conformance
|*Test 8* 2+|/conf/model-conventions/model-origin
| |*Requirement* |/req/openflight/model-origin
| |*Test purpose* |Verify that the model origin _is_ located at the center of the bounding rectangle and that along the Z axis, the origin _as_ selected allows the model to be correctly positioned on the ground for ground related models on or a water plane for surface and subsurface platforms.
| |*Test method* |Visual. Pass if the model is correctly positioned in the display.
| |*Test type* |Conformance
|*Test 9* 2+|/conf/model-conventions/t2-model-coordinates
| |*Requirement* |/req/openflight/ t2-model-coordinates
| |*Test purpose* |Verify that the latitude (y) and longitude (x) coordinates are expressed in decimal degrees and that the values are relative to the file’s (implicit) origin which is the south-west corner of the tile.
| |*Test method* |Visual. Pass if coordinates are expressed in decimal degrees..
| |*Test type* |Conformance
|*Test 10* 2+|/conf/model-conventions/roll-pitch-yaw
| |Requirement |req/openflight/roll-pitch-yaw
| |Test purpose |Verify that the Pitch, Roll and Yaw angles refer to rotations around the X, Y, and Z axes and Angles are measured in degrees. The Roll and Yaw angles vary from ±180 degrees while the Pitch angle is limited to the range ±90 degrees.
| |Test method |Visual. Pass if all angles are degrees
| |Test type |Conformance
|*Test 11* 2+|/conf/model-conventions/geometry
| |Requirement |req/openflight/geometry
| |Test purpose |Verify the implementers of the CDB OpenFlight standard adhere to set of constraints, rules and guidelines as defined in OpenFlight Requirement 11 when creating the geometry of Models.
| |Test method |Visual. Pass if all polygons are convex, all vertices of a polygon are in the same place, and that all polygon vertices (coordinates) have a counter-clockwise ordering.
| |Test type |Conformance
|*Test 12* 2+|/conf/model-conventions/ geometry-layer-constraint
| |Requirement |req/openflight/ geometry-layer-constraint
| |Test purpose |Verify that Layer 0, the base layer, contains geometry that completely encompasses the geometry of subsequent layers. Other layers areprocessed in order, one after the other. A layer is made of one or more nodes; all nodes of a given layer have the same relative priority.
| |Test method |Visual and software. Software can check processing order. Pass if the base layer contains a geometry that encompasses the geometry of sub-layers.
| |Test type |Conformance
