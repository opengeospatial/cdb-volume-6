|*Dependency* 2+|Openflight Specification
|*Test 37* 2+|/conf/model-textures/texture-file-loading
| |*Requirement* |/req/core/openflight/ texture-file-loading
| |*Test purpose* |Verify thatforn the case of GTModels and MModels, textures are separate files that are loaded after the model geometry files are read and loaded by client devices; in the case of GSModels and T2DModels, the textures can be loaded concurrently with the model geometry files.
| |*Test method* |Visual. Pass if units of measure are correct.
| |*Test type* |Conformance
|*Test 38* 2+|/conf/model- textures/qualterly-textures
| |*Requirement* |/req/openflight/quarterly-textures
| |*Test purpose* |Verify that the quarterly textures are provided as a complete set, i.e., it is assumed that all 4 textures of the same kind (i.e., all four textures have their component selector 1 set to 003) and are all present in the model’s texture directory
| |*Test method* |Visual. Pass if flags are correctly set.
| |*Test type* |Conformance
|*Test 39* 2+|/conf/ model- textures/monthly-textures
| |*Requirement* |/req/openflight/monthly-textures
| |*Test purpose* |Verify the monthly textures are provided as a complete set, i.e., it is assumed that all the 12 textures are of the same kind (i.e., all twelve textures have their component selector CS1 = 002) and are all present in the model’s texture directory.
| |*Test method* |Visual inspection. Pass if orientation is correct.
| |*Test type* |Conformance
|*Test 40* 2+|/conf/ model- textures/texture-mipmap
| |*Requirement* |/req/openflight/texture-mipmap
| |*Test purpose* |Verify that the mipmaps associated with a given texture are present in the texture directory. Furthermore, verify that the mipmaps are stored in individual files..
| |*Test method* |Visual inspection. Pass if orientation is correct.
| |*Test type* |Conformance
|*Test 41* 2+|/conf/ model- textures/texture-palette-path
| |*Requirement* |/req/openflight/texture-palette-path
| |*Test purpose* |Verify that the palette path is relative to the OpenFlight file
| |*Test method* |Visual inspection. Pass if orientation is correct.
| |*Test type* |Conformance
|*Test 42* 2+|/conf/ model- textures/texture-shadow-geometry
| |*Requirement* |/req/openflight/texture-shadow-geometry
| |*Test purpose* |Verify that when a geometry exists for the purpose of casting shadows that the geometry is located under an OpenFlight object node whose Shadow flag is set
| |*Test method* |Visual inspection. Pass if orientation is correct.
| |*Test type* |Conformance
|*Test 43* 2+|/conf/ model- textures/model-skin-textures
| |*Requirement* |/req/openflight/model-skin-textures
| |*Test purpose* |Verify that the mapping of textures for a given model or cultural features is identical since only the texture is changed, not the UV mapping
| |*Test method* |Visual inspection. Pass if orientation is correct.
| |*Test type* |Conformance
|*Test 44* 2+|/conf/ model- textures/model-night-maps
| |*Requirement* |/req/openflight/model-night-maps
| |*Test purpose* a|
Verify that a night map has the same size as its base texture, that

a night map uses the same UV mapping as its base texture and that a night map has a similar format as its base texture (RGB or Intensity) plus an alpha channel

| |*Test method* |Visual inspection. Pass if orientation is correct.
| |*Test type* |Conformance
|*Test 45* 2+|/conf/ model- textures/model-night-generation
| |*Requirement* |/req/openflight/model-night-generation
| |*Test purpose* |Verify that the Effect field of the multitexture record contains the value 0 indicating using the Texture Environment mapping defined in the Texture Attribute file. Verify that the Environment Type field found in the Texture Attribute file contains the value 2 indicating a Decal environment mapping
| |*Test method* |Visual inspection. Pass if orientation is correct.
